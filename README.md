# my-tutorials
A clearing house for tutorials.

A tutorial providing a tour of some basic lightkurve functionality is avaialble at "Lightkurve at TASC KASC July 2019".  The file with a similar name, but starting with "Collab" is the same jupyter notebook, but with a link to Google Collab at the top.  There are a few cells which you have to run in Collab, but not if you are using the tutorial locally and vice versa.  They're labeled.  (If you get an error -- double check that you didn't gloss over an instruciton on what environment to run the cell in...)
